# ProjectX

created the project and clone the project to my local file
then i added Jetski-cartier(Jeff Githinji 662873) as my collaborater
we created an error on his clone that he took from my main and we restored the error created by removing and updated the error

When i tried to create an error from his about page i was unable but we went ahead and merged the changes and Jeff githinji commented on the merge to change the error on future merges
